# Capstone_Application_Draft2
Final Project for Claim Academy: WEDDINGTON Wedding Planner

Made in visual studio with the MVC template.

It is a simple list maker application that lets you pick from different lists for planning a wedding with options to add custom items to the list. 

Here you'll find some of the changes made from the MVC template I used in order to make the webapp function in the way I was needing it to work.
